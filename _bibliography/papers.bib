Sluijter and Van Heuven (1996) reported that spectral tilt is a more reliable cue to stress than intensity. However, that study included only a small number of talkers (10) and only syllables with the vowels /aː/ and /ɔ/.},

	abstract = {Talkers vary in how they speak, resulting in acoustic variability in segments and prosody. Previous studies showed that listeners deal with segmental variability through perceptual learning and that these learning effects are stable over time. The present study examined whether this is also true for lexical stress variability. Listeners heard Dutch minimal pairs (e.g., {VOORnaam} vs. {voorNAAM}, ‘first name’ vs. ‘respectable’) spoken by two talkers. Half of the participants heard Talker 1 using only F0 to signal lexical stress and Talker 2 using only intensity. The other half heard the reverse. After a learning phase, participants were tested on words spoken by these talkers with conflicting stress cues (‘mixed items’; e.g., Talker 1 saying voornaam with F0 signaling initial stress and intensity signaling final stress). We found that, despite the conflicting cues, listeners perceived these items following what they had learned. For example, participants hearing the example mixed item described above who had learned that Talker 1 used F0 perceived initial stress ({VOORnaam}) but those who had learned that Talker 1 used intensity perceived final stress ({voorNAAM}). Crucially, this result was still present in a delayed test phase, showing that talker-specific learning about lexical stress is stable over time.},

	title = {Syllable rate drives rate normalization, but is not the only factor},
	abstract = {Speech is perceived relative to the speech rate in the context. It is unclear, however, what information listeners use to compute speech rate. The present study examines whether listeners use the number of syllables per unit time (i.e., syllable rate) as a measure of speech rate, as indexed by subsequent vowel perception. We ran two rate-normalization experiments in which participants heard durationmatched word lists that contained either monosyllabic vs. bisyllabic words (Experiment 1), or monosyllabic vs. trisyllabic pseudowords (Experiment 2). The participants’ task was to categorize an /ɑ-aː/ continuum that followed the word lists. The monosyllabic condition was perceived as slower (i.e., fewer /aː/ responses) than the bisyllabic and trisyllabic condition. However, no difference was observed between bisyllabic and trisyllabic contexts. Therefore, while syllable rate is used in perceiving speech rate, other factors, such as fast speech processes, mean F0, and intensity, must also influence rate normalization.},

	abstract = {We examined the effect of word stress position on bilingual auditory cognate processing. Turkish–Dutch early bilinguals who are dominant in their L2 (Dutch) performed an auditory lexical decision task in Turkish or Dutch. While Dutch has variable word stress, with a tendency for penultimate stress, stress in Turkish is mostly predictable and usually falls on the ultimate syllable. Our tasks included two-syllable cognates with penultimate stress in both languages, ultimate stress in both languages, or ultimate stress in Turkish and penultimate stress in Dutch. Some cognate facilitation effects arose in Dutch, while inhibition was found in Turkish. Cognates with ultimate stress were processed faster than cognates with penultimate stress, in both languages. This shows that in Turkish–Dutch early bilinguals, cognate processing depends on Turkish stress position, although Dutch is dominant. Together, the findings support the view that cognates have separate, though linked representations.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
