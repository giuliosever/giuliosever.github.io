Our paper 'Is rate-dependent perception affected by linguistic information about the intended syllable rate?â€™, 
authored by Giulio Severijnen, [Hans Rutger Bosker](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/bosker-h), and [James McQueen](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/mcqueen-j), was published in *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review*.

In this paper, we examined which types of information listeners use during rate-dependent perception. More specifically, is it mostly driven by acoustic information (i.e., low-level, acoustics), or do listeners also make use of non-acoustic, linguistic information, such as tracking the number of syllables.

We showed that listeners primarily seem to use acoustic cues, and not linguistic knowledge about the number of syllables rate during rate-dependent perception. These results are thus best accounted for by domain-general theories of rate-dependent perception.
