On February 14th, 2025, I successfully defended my PhD dissertation (with distinction cum laude) at the Radboud University Nijmegen.

I'm very happy to announce that on a day filled with warm words, interesting questions and discussions, I defended my dissertation. I'm looking back on a day filled with pride, joy, and I'm looking forward for new things to come. A special thanks to my supervisors, the reading committee, the members of the examination board, and everyone who attended the ceremony.

    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
