I'm honored to have been awarded an [NWO Rubicon grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/rubicon)!

The grant will allow me to start as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Spoken Language group](https://www.bcbl.eu/en/research/research-groups/spoken-language) at the [Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language](https://www.bcbl.eu/en) with Dr. Efthymia Kapnoula and Prof. Arthur Samuel.

Excited to be continuing my research on perceptual learning about segments and prosody, and to examine the underlying cognitive processes. Even more excited to be doing this in beautiful San Sebastián and to join the BCBL!
