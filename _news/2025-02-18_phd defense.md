On February 14th, 2025, I succesfully defended my PhD thesis, with distinction cum laude, at the Radboud University Nijmegen.

After years of hard work, I'm happy and proud to say that I succesfully defended my PhD thesis. It was a wonderful day with warm words, interesting questions and discussion, and filled with happiness and joy. A special thanks to my supervisors, the committee, and those who attended the ceremony. I couldn't be more proud!

My dissertation is now also available online, and can be found [here](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/315703).
