**Description**
This corpus contains speech recordings, recorded from 22 native speakers of Dutch (9F/13M). Participants produced Dutch minimal stress pairs, differing in whether they have initial or final stress (e.g., *VOORnaam vs. voorNAAM*, 'first name' vs. 'respectable'). The corpus contains all the recordings, forced-aligned Praat TextGrids, and manually checked word-level and syllable-level annotations. 

This is a subset of the data that has been analyzed in [Severĳnen, G.G.A., Bosker, H.R., & McQueen, J.M. (2024). Your “VOORnaam” is not my “VOORnaam”: An acoustic analysis of individual talker differences in word stress in Dutch. *Journal of Phonetics*, 103, 101296.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2024.101296).
