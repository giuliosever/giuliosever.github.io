Welcome! I am Giulio Severijnen, a postdoctoral researcher at the [International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA)](http://sissa.it) in Trieste, Italy. My research focusses on understanding how humans learn and perceive language, and what the underlying cognitive mechanisms are. At SISSA, I am working with prof. Davide Crepaldi, focussing on the neural mechanisms of statistical learning and reading.

Previously, I was a PhD candidate at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cogntition, and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/en/donders-institute)/[Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://mpi.nl), where I investigated how people deal with between-talker variability in prosody.
